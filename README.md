Here I will (at some point) analyse my hands, to realise how much I suck.

## Interesting projects
* https://pypi.org/project/poker/
* https://github.com/worldveil/deuces

## Build your own HUD
* https://forumserver.twoplustwo.com/45/software/build-your-own-hud-771438/
* In *Settings > Playing History > Hand History* one can store a hand in a
custom directory immediately after it is done. This is what many HUD systems do.
